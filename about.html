                Qualified as an IT engineer with experience in UI designing but since childhood i was more interested in painting and learning new skills. I always had a passion to create new artwork and challenge myself, so from 2019 I began exploring my passion and started painting proffesionally. starting with small artworks soon I began painting on canvas and now i have created this website to exhibit my artwork.As the saying goes" A true artist is no one who is inspired but one who inspires other" - Salvador Dali
